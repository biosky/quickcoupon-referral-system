# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Key findings: 1) Anonymous coupon generation working correctly with share_clicked field, 2) WhatsApp share tracking endpoint functioning properly, 3) Redemption validation working - prevents redemption without sharing and allows after sharing, 4) Cashback properly populated from shopkeeper profile, 5) Double redemption prevention working. All backend APIs are fully functional."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "USER REPORTED ISSUES - Fixed routing bug: Added /generate-coupon route alongside /generate to handle both QR code formats. Frontend restarted. REGARDING ADS: Ads are properly implemented in LoginPage and CustomerDashboard with environment variables configured. If ads not showing, likely reasons: 1) Adsterra account needs approval, 2) Ad codes need time to activate (24-48hrs), 3) Ad blockers enabled, 4) Need to check Adsterra dashboard for ad status."

Solution: Modified /api/shopkeeper/profile endpoint to preserve existing promotional_image when no new image is uploaded. Backend restarted successfully."

    message: "USER REPORTED 3 CRITICAL BUGS - Fixed all: 1) WhatsApp not opening: Changed from wa.me to api.whatsapp.com/send URL, added fallback for popup blockers, always opens in new tab to prevent navigation issues. 2) Promotional image not rendering: Added image display in shop info card with proper styling and max-height. 3) Logout issue: Fixed by ensuring WhatsApp always opens in new tab (_blank) instead of replacing current page, preventing session loss. Frontend restarted."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "USER REPORTED: Ads not rendering on website. FIXED: 1) Added https: protocol to ad script URLs (was missing), 2) Added AD_KEY environment variable, 3) Replaced manual script injection with AdsterraAd component, 4) Fixed multiple container ID issue (each ad now has unique container), 5) Added proper error handling and loading states, 6) Updated both LoginPage and CustomerDashboard to use new ad implementation. Frontend restarted. NOTE: If ads still don't show, verify Adsterra account is approved and ad codes are active in Adsterra dashboard."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "USER REPORTED CRITICAL ANDROID BUG: After WhatsApp sharing on Android, redeem button not appearing (works on iOS). ROOT CAUSE: Android browsers don't consistently fire 'visibilitychange' event when returning from WhatsApp. FIXES IMPLEMENTED: 1) Added multiple detection methods: visibilitychange, focus, pageshow, and resume events for maximum Android compatibility, 2) Persist share state in localStorage to survive page reloads, 3) Mobile detection - on Android, enable redeem button with 3-second delay after share click as fallback, 4) Use window.location.href for WhatsApp on mobile (better than window.open), 5) Restore share state from localStorage on page load. Frontend restarted. This ensures redeem button appears on Android regardless of browser event support."
