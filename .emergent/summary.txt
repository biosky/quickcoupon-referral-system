The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack React, FastAPI, and MongoDB referral coupon system, progressing from initial setup to a feature-rich application. The development was highly iterative, frequently responding to user feedback and debugging deployment-specific challenges on Render. Key phases included initial app scaffolding, extensive debugging of deployment issues (e.g., yarn install v1.22.22

The engineer also integrated Adsterra ads with careful attention to user experience and added QR code functionality for easier customer access. The most recent efforts focused on simplifying the customer journey, removing the need for login/signup, and eventually, all customer data for public coupon generation. The AI demonstrated strong debugging skills and adaptability to evolving product requirements.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a minimal, mobile-friendly web app for a physical-store referral coupon/cashback system.
**Key Functionality & Requirements:**
1.  **Authentication:** Login/signup for customers and shopkeepers with username, email, phone number, and password (name was later removed). Users should remain logged in.
2.  **Two Interfaces:**
    *   **Customer:** Previously, customers logged in to generate unique coupons and share links. Now, they scan a QR code, directly access a public coupon generator, and copy a link without login or providing personal data.
    *   **Shopkeeper Dashboard:** Shopkeepers log in to manage profiles, view and manage issued coupons, view analytics, and can delete their profile. Cashback is customizable as Cashback/Offer (flexible text field).
3.  **Referral & Cashback Logic:**
    *   Unique, shareable coupon generated after interaction.
    *   Coupon redemption depends on the original customer clicking the Copy Link button 3 times.
    *   After the 3rd click, a 2-3 second delay occurs, then a Redeem Cashback button activates.
    *   Clicking Redeem Cashback triggers a Congratulations, you have successfully earned the cashback/combo pop-up.
    *   Real-time updates across dashboards for coupon and cashback status.
    *   If 3 clicks are not achieved, cashback is zero, no pop-up.
4.  **Offer Information:** Shared links should display full promotional details with store info and a pamphlet/image. Promotional images are customizable by shopkeepers.
5.  **UI/UX:**
    *   Prominently display CASHBACK / COMBO on the frontend.
    *   How It Works guide.
    *   Simple, single-page flow per interface.
    *   Mobile-friendly design.
    *   QR code generation for shopkeepers to share with customers, redirecting to the coupon generator with pre-filled shopkeeper ID.
    *   Website name: QuickCoupon, no Emergent branding or preview text.
6.  **Rules & Privacy:**
    *   Interface does not display click count to customers; only shopkeepers see all coupon stats.
    *   No indication to customers about tracking.
    *   Shopkeeper coupons must have unique IDs.
7.  **Monetization:** Integrate Adsterra ads strategically on the Login Page and Customer Dashboard (small banner top, between sections), avoiding intrusive placements.

- The  is still being updated to remove all customer data input, as per the latest user request. The final implementation for this page needs to be completed and tested.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing the final simplification of the customer journey for coupon generation. The user explicitly requested that customers should *not* need to login, signup, or provide *any* data (including phone number). They should simply scan a QR code, be redirected to a coupon generator page, and then copy the link.

The backend was already updated to support a public coupon generation endpoint. The  routes were updated to include  which points to . The QR code in  was updated to point to this new public generator URL.

The last action performed was an  on , which indicates the AI is modifying this file to remove any input fields or data collection for customers, aligning with the no customer data requirement. This is the immediate task being worked on to complete the customer-facing flow.
